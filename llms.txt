# grype-db

Anchore's vulnerability database builder for Grype - transforms upstream vulnerability data into actionable security intelligence.

## Overview

grype-db is a Go-based application that aggregates vulnerability data from multiple upstream sources (NVD, GitHub, Red Hat, etc.) and builds a comprehensive vulnerability database used by Grype vulnerability scanner. It processes various data formats and creates a unified SQLite database with standardized vulnerability information.

## Core Components

### Database Building (`cmd/grype-db/`)
- `main.go` - CLI entry point with commands: build, pull, package, cache
- `cli/commands/` - Command implementations for data operations
- `application/` - Core application logic and configuration

### Data Processing (`pkg/process/`)
- Processors for different vulnerability sources (NVD, GitHub, OS vendors, etc.)
- Schema versioning support (v5, v6) for backward compatibility
- Data transformers for normalizing vulnerability formats

### Provider System (`pkg/provider/`)
- Interfaces for vulnerability data sources
- Vunnel integration for upstream data fetching
- File and SQLite-based data storage

### Database Management (`manager/`)
- Python-based database management utilities
- Distribution and validation tooling
- S3 integration for database publishing

## Key Features

- Multi-source vulnerability aggregation (NVD, GitHub Security Advisories, OS vendors)
- Schema versioning with backward compatibility
- Caching system for efficient data updates
- Database packaging and distribution
- Validation and testing frameworks

## Usage

```bash
# Build database from all sources
grype-db -g

# Build from specific providers
grype-db -g -p nvd,github

# Pull data only
grype-db pull -p nvd

# Package for distribution
grype-db package
```

The tool requires a GitHub token for accessing GitHub Security Advisories and uses vunnel for upstream data management.
