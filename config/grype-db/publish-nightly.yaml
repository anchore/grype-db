  # No manual configs are provided since 'provider.vunnel.generateConfigs' is set to true
  # this means that well run vunnel to get the list of supported providers. All supported providers
  # will be included in the database build. This prevents the need from manually updating this file
  # for every new provider that is added.
  #
  # Any providers that should be excluded from processing should be added to the 'provider.vunnel.excludeProviders' list.
